Exercise 2
1.  A person's id should dictate their name.  A car's license plate number should dictate their make, model, capacity, and driver id. 	 
2.  They all conform.
3.  Maybe some kind of location field to help with distances (not everyone lives in the same home, necessarily.  It would be really cute if you guys did).  

Exercise 4.
1.  If the sets of drivers driving back and forth are inconsistent, the query will return the ids of those drivers that are only driving one way.
2.  If someone riding to work does not have a ride home, their id is returned.
3.  If the number of passengers in a car exceeds the capacity or is less than 2, the query will return the lpn, the capacity, and the number of passengers currently in the car.
